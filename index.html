    <h2>about</h2>
    <div style="width: 471px; height: 102px;"><p>Ego has no place in the design process. Fail quickly to succeed quickly.
        Negative feedback is a gift. Universal design is ethical design.
        Designers are toolmakers.
        Meet people where they are. Be a facilitator.
        Define the problem. Play. There's always more than one solution.
        Empathy is the key to resonance. You are not your user.</p></div>
